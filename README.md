This is the project for the Qantas senior engineer coding challenge.

The coding challenge instructions and files received can be found on the folder 'coding-challenge-files'.

This application was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Pre-requisites

- You would need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and NPM installed on your machine to be able to run the application.

- After installing NodeJS and NPM, clone the project on your local machine.

- You would then need to install the dependencies by running 'npm install' once on the root directory.

## Getting Started
Run the development server using the command below:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application on port 3000 by default.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the command

```bash
npm run dev
```
